The holy temple which was destroyed by the Mughal invaders about 500 years ago has been saved after many sacrifices and struggles.  Archaeological evidence of this has even been shown.  It was not just a matter of national pride or religious ambition, but added a unique dimension to the achievement of civilizational excellence and a blow to Mughal imperialism.  Hope the Sri Krishna temple and Kashi Vishwanath temple will be saved soon.  Jai Sriram  May God's grace be upon all."

@agninagaseshu3216,1 day ago,"The upcoming opening of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya  India has created a sense of global anticipation. The event scheduled for January 22nd, is not just being awaited by citizens of India, but by devotees and followers from around the world. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad  organized a car rally in New Jersey, United States as an early commemoration of the Pran Pratistha ceremony, with participation from the Hindu community across the region. The fervor extends to Nepal and Sri Lanka as well, with both countries contributing sacred gifts for the temple's construction. The Ram Lalla Idol, a symbol central to the temple's significance, is now stationed in the garbhagraha. The preparations for the temple's opening are shining a light on the unifying strength of shared devotion, transcending geographical boundaries. With excitement building across the globe, the Ram temple's opening is set to be a landmark moment not only for Ayodhya and India, but for the devotees worldwide."

Sleeping on a blanket on the floor and denying himself luxury, the PM only consumes Coconut water and participates daily in Gau Puja, a ritual feeding of cows. The Prime Minister also practices special mantras during the Brahma Muhurat for one hour and eleven minnutes. Embracing this fusion of spirituality and tradition,  the Prime Minister becomes an integral part of the divine choreography leading to the revered occasion in January at Ayodhya."

But Vigraha means, something which is imparted energy and vibrations via chanting of mantras. The term ‚ÄúVigraha‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have an English translation. You would be doing a great disservice to our community if you say ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù."

This ongoing Ram temple episode is 10000000+ million times better than the Islamic jihad circus..  Hence Ram temple scenario will act as a powerful shield against Jihad circus, Commie circus and Woke circus in India,  So personally I am happy.. üòÖ   Religion is a phenomenon which is here to stay whether we like it or not !

India will remain plural, democratic and politically stable only if Hindus are in majority, if they lose majority population status then India will turn into places like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, Yemen, Iran and other similar shitholes.

India can never become secular because of its extremely conservative traditionalistic society,  at the most it can only be a plural nation.   I also dream, imagine and wish that India should be a secular nation, but alas there is absolutely no point in it nor my personal dreams, imaginations or wishes have any practical value....  Secularism in India is completely impractical and impossible.

@NoName-yn9bt,1 month ago (edited),"In terms of numbers exceeding 100 million followers, there are four major religions in the world - Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. America should remain Christian. India should remain Hindu. The same goes for Islamic and Buddhist countries. Most Hindu temples outside India are built by Hindu immigrants. A good number of mosques and churches exist in India primarily because of pre-Mughal era Islamic invasions, and the Mughal rule (1526- 1707), and the British rule that lasted from 1858 to 1947. They were not built by permanent immigrants from other countries in India who later became citizens.

Hinduism will do no good for America, and Christianity is of no worth in India, its mission is about breaking up families, and sowing division between communities, and instigating political instability. The two religions have nothing in common. We can make a deal with the Americans. All Hindu temples in the USA will be shut down and all churches in India will also be closed. We want to promote a diverse world. We want them to be Christian and we want to be Hindu. We do not want foreign origin religions that came and forcibly established themselves in India during the Islamic and colonial eras. Likewise, let Buddhist countries be Buddhist and Islamic countries be Islamic. Let us promote a religiously diverse world in which each country practices its own faith that was born on its own soil."

@kavialaganarjunan7157,4 months ago,"It is so embarassing to see national newspapers talking about this princess Heo-Hwang-Okto be from Ayodhya in order to fit their funny agenda. The UP government and the central government have been reinterpreting history to suit their needs. 

""Heo was the princess of Ayuta Kingdom which was located in the southern part of India. Some people wrongly connect Ayuta Kingdom with Ayodhya. But the ancient name of Ayodhya was ‚ÄòSaketa‚Äô during that time and Samguk Yusa was written long back in the 13th century. Therefore it does not refer to Ayodhya. Ayuta Kingdom here refers to ‚ÄúAy Kingdom‚Äù that belonged to the Pandyan dynasty of ancient Tamilakam. This can be substantiated with the fact that princess Heo carried with her the symbol of Twin fish in trident. Pandyan Kingdom depicts two fishes on their flags, coins, and emblem. The fish symbol is considered to be one of the most meaningful symbols in the lives of the people living in Pandyan Kingdom. Princess Heo was also known by the name Sembavalam in Tamil which means red coral. Interestingly, the Korean name Heo Hwang-Ok also shares the same meaning. ""

And for all those people who would be bashing me for these comments, you could go and check the similarities in the Tamil Culture and the Korean Culture. The words used, the traditions and there are several videos and documents on the internet that would prove this similarity. If any of you have a Korean friend you could ask them too. It is embarrassing how neither the Tamil Nadu State government nor the Central government is aware of this reinterpretation of history."

While the symbol of twin fish is actually true. The queen lived during the 13th century and the kings of the alleged South Indian dynasty Pandiyan is from 12-14th century. The story is that the queen travelled to Korea via sea in a ship n had brought a stone with her in the ship to withstand the wind. If the queen is from UP hw did she have access to ships n sea when that region is land locked n covered with mountains on one end. Meanwhile the dynasty thats in South India travelled through ships n were makers of ships as it was a mode of transportation. And the region suspected as the place of the princess is around Kanyakumari which is covered with sea. The story is true or not I am not sure, but logic of a land locked place had ships n the era 12-17th century when Mughals were ruling had a non Mughal princess is not correlating either."

Surirathna went via Sea not via mountains. So your √†nother argument failed too. And let me remind you, Koreans know their history. And let me correct you Queen Surirathna WAS BORN in AD 32.

@peyanshuverma2937,1 day ago,Hmm so basically everything was peaceful and then suddenly a Hindu decided that he wanted to pray inside a mosque and the rest others ended up blindly following him and demolished the masjid and the government to get votes ruled that a Mandir should be built. Just a game of a few peoples egos getting hurt and people created a big issue out of it in the name of religion.

The Truth: when Congress was in power they used it to appease antis and when bjp is in power they are using it to appease pros, in reality it was place of historical and cultural significance and had nothing to do with politics, The decision of the Supreme Court is very true and it's victory of Indian judiciary which gave true(it's obvious that there has to be birthplace of Shri Ram in Ayodhya on side of saryu) judgement in such a tense situation. Let's be sensible citizens let us  put an end to religion based politics,  let's be educated on matters like economics and foreign policy of our country, let's develop a free mindset so that no one can use us as political assets, let us work unitedly for this great land ,let's free it from pros and antis, let it be country of Indians only üáÆüá≥

Babar, Aurangzeb k pas power tha to mandir tod diya, jab power game badla to Masjid ke Jaga Mandir aagya, jo ki teek b hai, bcoz Hindus faith is there in Ayodhya.

Why Christians fighting for Jerusalem? Simple because it the birth place of Jesus.
Why Muslims too have claim there, because it is believed that Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven from here. So, Jerusalem is important for these religions, is there any hisorical validation for every thing here? No, people believe it because it was written in there holy scripture.

Same way Ayodhya is a holy place for hindus. There is mention of Ayodhya in Ramayana, and if ur are saying babar came b4 Ramayana then may god bless you.

And if u r saying there is not historical evidence for it, then it the same for every religion."

Thousands of Hindu temples were destroyed in Bangladesh. Thousands of Hindu homes were attacked in our country. Many Pakistani temples were bombed. I was not born yet. I heard from my parents. My father and the other young boys of the village guarded the village temple. When it was attacked, my father was seriously injured. He still has a mark on his hand. But who cares about us?"

@malinisarovar,1 day ago,"Banking on a temple to boost India's soft power, even the need of discussing it in social media is not very promising for India's future. Religion has to be a personal choice. We don't want religion to be a factor to assert our power anywhere. Rather individuals should assert their power on their individual capabilities , talents and efforts. The same goes for the country. Sriram is always here, with or without the temple. If we can only feel his presence by a temple being built in Ayodhya, then all of us need to go back and study Ramayanam again and this time learn it the right way. Building this temple after all the tragic events that occured in past several hundred years, is historic and is a reason to rejoice for all those who has been waiting for this. Please leave it at that and don't connect it to the country's power."
@edwinvarghese9782,1 day ago,"It's as clear as daylight that the temple is a result of pure vote bank politics. Everything about this temple has been bloodied by our citizens despite their religious orientation. 
Is it really worth it ? A national holiday for the central government employees just to attend the Pooja ? All the media attention about the PM being the chief guest isn't it a paid gimmick for the upcoming elections ? Isn't there somewhere we are losing the soul of our constitution that's routed in secularism, equality and unity rooted in diversity ? I guess these are some of the questions  the media should raise."

All these biased news medias struggle to imply how the Muslim community would be affected negatively by the new temple. None of these media guys wish to ever acknowledge that several thousand sacred temples, all across our beloved Bharath, were systematically vandalized, looted, destroyed, masks built over..etc atrocities were perpetuated by the invaders. Time for us to ignore these  false narratives and continue building a strong  homeland and progress without any heed for such hateful news (Propaganda) entities.

@jaykay304,16 hours ago,"Yes India will definitely benefit. 

1) From a religious perspective most Hindus will be relieved and will want to go and pray at the mandir after so many years

2) From a social cohesion perspective hopefully we can all put the past behind us like the PM said and all Indian Hindus & Muslims can live in harmony together which will be good for the country

3) Hindus from all over India and abroad will visit Ayodhya which will result in a lot of income for UP and India. Plus there will be a lot tourism by non Hindus

4) The Ram Mandir will result in thousands of jobs being created in and around the Mandir, plus jobs in Hotels, Restaurants, Airports, Bus Stations and Rail Stations. This will result in a lot of employment, tax revenue for the government and act as a major boost for the State and Local economy and perhaps the national economy

originally secularism is a state principle treating everyone equally while protecting the native way of life but in Bharat the secularism is forced on the majority Hindu community while state is busy in shariya implementation while vilifying the victims of the abrahamic invasions and persecution  for 1000 years. 
Actually this is the first secular government in the post 1947 era of Bharat. But we no more fancy it. While we were celebrating the arrival of Bhagvan RAM yesterday, the peaceful community was busy pelting stones on the celebrations, that tells you what is on their minds."

FYI , EUROPEAN EDUCATION SYSTEM NEEDS COMPLETE REFORMS n TRANSFORMATIONS.
European Education System esp Britain's universities have¬†created, manifested and did all kinds of manipulated knowledge n indoctrination of Educational Values. 
They promoting¬† intellectual pollution n intellectual terrorism with Mastermind hidden agenda. 

WORLD WARS , Intellectuals terrorism at NATO,¬† Financial fraud businesses in Swiss bank are World No1 Hidden Agenda and World biggest Blunders. These are outcomes of EUROPEAN Education System n Educational CURRICULUM n Intellectual pollution. 

These educational institutions n universities are 100% Fake & False and indoctrination of Educational values.

They are more materialistic mindset and doesn't know any values of practical life and spiritual values n Spiritual life.
These people are most IRRELEVANT,¬† IRRATIONAL n MOST SENSELESS.

Some Sold-out Indian are Dangerous to the whole world example is 
Erode Venkatappa Ramasamy/ PERIYAR used to believe and accept these British n Britain's conspiracies.¬†¬† These kind of people sold-out to British n Communists worked against Indian culture n Educational values. 
So PERIYAR is dumb follower who doesn't have sense of reasoning and sense of evaluation.¬† Doesn't have¬†Sense of understanding but he is egotistical person who gets aggressive without understanding the reality and truth. PERIYAR was least interested in facts, truth and reality.

@donaldfernandes7798,23 hours ago,"The Ram Temple could have been built anywhere in Ayodhya, but the BJP chose the Babri Masjid site, where Lord Ram is alleged to have been born. The aim was to destroy the Masjid and build the temple. After so many years of court hearings, the Muslims withdrew their claim to the Babri Masjid. The Masjid was destroyed, despite the restraint placed by the Supreme Court. 
While Hindus the world over and in India are celebrating, the  four Sankaracharyas of the Hindu religion were not invited. They said that, even if they were invited, they would not attend, because the Ram Temple has flaws. They made it clear that the procedures of sacred rituals were not followed.
This was shocking because, when the overseers of the Hindu religion are not invited and if invited, they are unwilling to attend, it only means that there is something very serious, that Hindu Bhakts are not aware of. Besides the Mandir has not been completed. This is of grave concern. The Sankaracharyas have explained in detail.

The Ram Mandir is the focal rallying point for all Hindus as it stands now. But the custodians of the Hindu religion, the Sankaracharyas have unequivocally distanced themselves from the Ram Mandir. Nobody seems to have consulted them. Even if someone had consulted them, the Sankaracharyas would have not permitted the Ram Mandir to be built. People in the political establishment must have known it and hence the Sankaracharyas were bypassed. 

This is the sad part of the Ram Mandir. The temple for Lord Rama should be above all politics and selfish motives. Most important of all, permissions should have been sought from the Sankaracharyas whether to build the temple or not.

Here in your comment I very well accept what you said that focus should be made on development rather than pushing religious matters of any community..

That being said.. Breaking of the mosque was unconstitutional as it was not ordered by the court ..
That could have been done in a constitutional way through Supreme courts order..

But Building of the Temple was totally constitutional as case was won through the Supreme court.

The temple was demolished by unconstitutional elements and so was Majid demolished by unconstitutional elements..
But the Building of Temple is nowhere wrong, it is constitutional and even from the development perspective.. it's good for tourism.

Shri Rama for all and all for Shri Rama. A new era with a message to the world,  Love All. Every game begins with the same score, it is quite normal. This will be much more. Sanatana, the everlasting one with the score remaining even, for every one, always.
From now on there can never be only one and it will always  be everyone, everywhere and everything by consensus. There is no exception or denial. 
Promote diversity and unity again in Bharat after 800 years of subjugation and misery at the hands of foreign invaders who made India their home. Yet they could not make it their own. India could never be made for only one but remained and belonged to everyone. 

Today we are heavy on our back and strong in our heads. Backward civilisation will decide between lag & lose or share & shine. Benefits and reservations are always in aid for seeking progress and nation building. NRC and UCC are the way to go after the success of 370. Save your identity yet create national unity. Demonstrate love and respect. Gaza is a bad choice.

RSS chief has sent a clear message from Ayodhya after the Shri Rama Lalla consecration ceremony. That is to exercise restraint and work hard to make this nation great again. Vishwa Guru banna hai.

	7)  Manipulation of Bharat Ratna Awards - Self Awarded Bharat Ratna.




3. Rajiv Gandhi with Lok Sabha(406/543) - Highest and Worst Outcome of his Governance. [Congress never ever got majority after that]

	1) IPKF - Many soldiers were martyred for an unknown cause. Sending IPKF to Sri Lanka was a monumental blunder. He even got killed for it.

	   Highest Illegal Activities [Racketeering, Dacoity, Smuggling, Extryism, Extortion, Loan sharking, Human trafficking, Money laundering, Terrorism, Arms Trafficking, Gambling, Bribery, murder and forgery]

	2) He messed with Pakistan and prolonged Kalisthan issue, Kashmir unrest and massacre of Kashmiri  pandits started in his time

	3) Indoctrination of INSTITUTIONS and JUDICIARY and media

	4) Continued Pseudo Secularism - Appease the Muslim vote bank

	5) Manipulation and Supporting Foreign Nationals - 
For Eg. Bhopal gas tragedy Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) 

	6) Manifestation of Terror Group Assam, Tamilnadu/Srilanka

	7) Series of Scams and Scandals like Bofors scandal - Highest level of Corruption 

	8) Bhopal Gas tragedy - No Proper compensation, Safe passage of Anderson, Never ending trial, etc

	9) He used to go to Lakshadweep islands and Andaman Islands with his Italian relatives accompanied by 100 servants and 1200 security personnel and enjoy.

	10) Sikhs were butchered in post Indira Gandhi assassination and Exodus of Hindus from the land of Kashmir happened under his nose.


4. NEHRU ( Along with JINNAH,  SHEIKH ABDULLAH, GEELANI, MAULANA ABDUL AZAD,  and EV Ramaswamy PERIYAR) 


Nehru was master of hidden master in most Cunning PM of all the PM put together.

1) Neharu was not a Pandit or NOT EVEN  A LEADER. 

First get the facts right ‚úÖ as shown below: 
Neharu statement itself talks about his hidden character I.e.
‚ÄúBy education I‚Äôam an Englishman, by views an internationalist, by culture a Muslim and Hindu only by accident of birth- Jawaharlal Nehru‚Äù.

2) Not just statement,¬† if you intersection n introspection his lifetime,¬† you will find his character n behavior full of Cunningness n false leadership n negative leadership Qualities which is hidden n negative mastermind conspiracies which is hidden üòâ

3) Why did Nehru internationalise the Kashmir dispute by referring it to the United Nations? 
Why did he consent to Article 370 which hindered the  princely state‚Äôs total integration with India? Why did he have to lose a third of Jammu and Kashmir when the region in its entirety was attainable?

4) Why was he interested on Sheikh Abdulla and his family members n relatives and Why he was keen on Article 370 to implement n his party n friends wanted to continue it. Patel was skeptical on this policyüò¢ 

5) Reality is that , Neharu's conspiracies are TRILLIONS and his contribution are thousands.¬† 
Just because trillions can't be listed out in this doesn't mean and some think that his conspiracies are less or worthless ü§î. 
Some are absolutely mastermindly lhidden agendas.¬†

6)  Never supported permanent membership in UN.

7)  Most of his international dealing were completely conspiracies and mastermind hidden agenda n secrets. 

8) World No1 Worst Political Polices, Rules and Ideas .v2.
1. On Separate Nation i.e., Kashmir before Independence itself. 
2. Article 370, after Independence  .
E.g.,  World's Worst Ideas are Divide India with separate Kashmir nation, and Article 370 and continuations, and many other useless Polies and Rules, etc.


-----------------------------------------------------------
STRONGEST-WISE RANKING OF PMs:

1. Subhash Chandra Bose (Supposed to be First PM )

2. Vallabhai PATEL (First Elected PM and Gandhi did conspiracies and made Nehru as PM) 

3. LAL BAHADUR SASTRI
4. Atal Behari Vajpayee + ADVANI 
6. Narendra Modi
7.  Yogi Adityanath  ( Future PM )

====================================
BEST  & INTEGRITY WISE Ranking of PMs are:

1. Subhash Chandra Bose 

2. Vallabhai PATEL 

3. LAL BAHADUR SASTRI 

4. ATAL Bihari Vaypayee + ADVANI 

5. MODI

6. MURARJI DESAI

7.  Inder Kumar Gujral 

8. Devegowda  
    (First person, who resigned Congress and later became PM) couldn't succeed or do progress.

@ProudIndian55555,1 day ago,"Title: Hindu Population Growth: An Urgent Appeal for Survival and Preservation of Sanatan Dharma

Dear Hindus,

As we approach the year 2024, it is important for us to reflect on the current state of our country and the future that we want for ourselves and our children. One of the most pressing issues facing our community today is the rapidly increasing population of Muslims in India. While we must acknowledge the financial burden that comes with having a larger family, it is essential that we take action to ensure the survival and prosperity of our Hindu community.

As Hindus, it is our responsibility to preserve and protect our religion, Sanatan Dharma, from any potential threats. One way to do this is by ensuring a steady growth in our population. The truth is, the Muslim population is increasing at a faster rate than ours, and their high fertility rates may lead to domination and division in the future. As Hindus, we need to increase our fertility rates and have larger families to counter this growth, maintain our majority, and prevent our religion from being overtaken.


To achieve this, it is essential to have more marriages and kids before the age of 25. Although having multiple children can be financially challenging for a Hindu family, it is a small price to pay for the survival of our religion. We must also acknowledge that the Muslim population has increased from 9% to 20% in recent years, and if we continue to have only one child, they will outnumber us.


The history of our nation is marred by the partition and the slaughter of Hindus, which was a direct result of the Muslim population increasing at an alarming rate. Despite this, we have managed to maintain a large Hindu population for centuries, which allowed us to resist the attempts of the Muslim conquerors to convert us.

History has proven that whenever Muslim populations rise, they dominate and target minorities. We must learn from the past and prevent similar scenarios from occurring in the future. Sanatan Dharma has survived for centuries, and we must ensure that it continues to thrive by increasing our population. We must also work towards establishing a Hindu Rashtra to protect ourselves and our religion from any anti-Hindu elements.

Unfortunately, the demographics of our country are changing, and the Hindu population is declining at an alarming rate due to our low fertility rate. On the other hand, the Muslim population continues to increase at a much faster rate, which puts us at risk of becoming a minority in our own country.

It is important to note that history has repeatedly shown us that whenever the Muslim population percentage increases, they dominate and kill the minorities or divide the existing land. We cannot afford to let this happen again in India. The only way to save Sanatan Dharma and ensure the survival of our community is to have a higher fertility rate than the Muslims.

We must also remember that the goal of the Muslims is to establish Ghazwa-E-Hind, which means the conquest of India. We cannot let this become a reality. We want Akhand Bharat, but we want it to be our land and not be overrun by Muslims from neighboring countries.

Furthermore, it is crucial that we support political parties that have the best interest of the Hindu community at heart, and not be misled by anti-Hindu parties like Khangress.

I urge all Hindus to have at least three children and to get married and have children before the age of 25. We must take action to save our religion, Sanatan Dharma, and ourselves by multiplying ourselves as soon as possible.

In conclusion, it is crucial for all Hindus to come together and take action to increase our population by having more children and early marriages by 25. We must not be misled by those who seek to undermine our religion and instead focus on preserving Sanatan Dharma for generations to come. Let's multiply ourselves and save our religion, our culture, and our identity. Jai Hind! Jai Shree Ram!"

Rajiv Malhotra wrote a good book called 'the sankrit untranslateables'
Atma is not soul.
Soul (in Abrahamic cultures) is immortal but not eternal.
Immortal means no death.
Eternal means always existing, ie no beginning and no end.
Beginning means end, birth means dead.
No beginning means no end.
This is just pre-school logic/philosophy.
Thank you so much for your attention.
I (and the whole world, including Bharat) would greatly appreciate and benefit from ceasing to use the word idol when we mean murti.
Jai Sri Raam!

Sure the mosque was a crime at the time it was built but, like it's predecessor, it required fine craftsmanship and a rich artisinal legacy and architectural imagination to complete.

Congratulations to India, which has struck a massive blow against the global jihad. In Ayodhya, Modi is about to inaugurate a Hindu temple on the site of a 16th century triumphal mosque that was built over an earlier Hindu temple that jihadis destroyed during the Mughal era. This is a historic day that demonstrates anew that the jihadis can be pushed back if people have the courage to face them down and stand against violence and intimidation.

@try_dc6366,1 day ago,"Jai Siya Ram to dear Palki mam üïâüôè. May Lord Ram bless you. For those who're not Indians or don't know about the History of this place. Here're some historical lessons for your awareness - 
India is the birthplace of Hinduism and so all the sacred places of Hindus are here. And just like Catholics has Vatican, Muslims have Mecca, for us there're four such places of worship of utmost importance - 1. City - Ayodhya (Birthplace of Lord Ram where Temple is being built) 2. Kashi (Important for Lord Shiva Temple - Gyanvyapi) 3. A temple in Mathura (Birthplace of Lord Krishna). 
            During centuries of invasions from West Asia (Islamic invaders), Muslim armies demolished others' religious places including Hindus and did massacres of those people of other faiths in the name of religion, converted them forcefully, implemented taxes (Jizya) on them. It doesn't stop here. They built mosques on these demolished temples to show their supremacy & instill fear in people of other faiths. The above 3 places were met with the same fate. These three places are being reclaimed one after another after centuries of struggle, dozens of communal riots and killings and of course more than 100 years old legal battle in courts (one such case is Ayodhya Ram Temple which was demolished & a mosque was built upon it). And this reclamation is being done fairly in the Courts of our country in a civilized manner (unlike those who broke those temples & those radical extremist Muslims who support their ideology to this day) with evidence & proofs (Archeological excavations as well as literary sources) put forward by Hindu lawyers as compared to none or non-serious proofs by Muslims side because they know they don't have any. It's clearly evident by looking at those mosques what's the truth btw. Anyway, Hindus won the Ayodhya case and Mosque was also demolished & now Ram Temple is being built, inaugurated & consecrated. Some good Muslims accepted & condemned the wrongs happened in the past, appreciated the temple, congratulated Hindus & are also celebrating with them but those who're frustrated and can't digest their loss in the case are crying on social media & playing victims as they do usually. A handful of Leftist/ Marxist journalists & propagandists (you can count them on fingers so there's a list below) are also spewing venom & hate in news media publications (you'll get who those people are if you come across any) because Hindus reclaimed their place of worship broken by Islamic Invaders like Babur, Aurangzeb, Bin Qasim (whom the colonized converted South Asian Muslims consider their father & servant of Allah - not all Muslims but many think like that).

The list of propagandists & Lefties loosing their mental stability very hard right now is below - 
- Audrey Tuschke.
- Ravish Kumar.
- Sakshi Joshi.
- Some opposition party leaders for political & ideological purposes.
- Some urban elites whom people don't give any importance to.
- Some foreign media propaganda media houses based in West (as per them PM Modi attending Ram Temple ceremony is bad & against secular principles of India and Joe Biden taking Presidential Oath on Holy Bible and UK PM attending religious ceremony of their King's coronation is not. Only this event will amount to so-called Hindu Nationalism, Hindu Supremacy, Majoritarianism and what not. New kinds of terms these hypocrites invent every day. Whoever is shouting these words, I tell them to look at the human rights situation in their own countries first & then give unwanted advice).

@Vikram_l,1 day ago (edited),"Soft Power is what the rest of the world perceives of us and how much it imbibes what we have to offer. Media houses such as yours with a wider global audience than the traditional media houses in India do an excellent job of this. Unfortunately, the majority of the outside world still shape their views of India through the stories carried by Global media houses such as the CNN, BBC & Al Jazeera (social media is helping a bit today but it still has a long way to go). The coverage by these organisations still portray this event as a Hindu Nationalist event that is alienating and making the Muslim population fearful. The headlines in bold letters refer to the ""demolition of the Babri Masjid"" but the original demolition of the Ram Mandir by Babur is buried in irrelevant small print somewhere in the middle of the story. They still refer to the site only as ""Hindus believe it to be the birthplace of Ram"", never a mention of the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court welcomed by all sides which took into consideration all archaeological and historical evidences. India would need to produce a global media house which could take on the likes of the CNN, BBC & Al Jazeera to project its soft power and and I wish Palki the very best in this endeavour."

@ambedkar.poisons.brahminpower,1 day ago,"Does any man want to experience heavenly pleasures in this human life?

Convert to Brahminism? Live as pious souls.
{ or follow the religions that hate Brahminism? }
{ or follow the social reformers? Like Ambedkar, Phule, Periyar Ramaswamy. }

Pious souls benefit their fellow human beings more than they receive from the creatures of nature, from the forces of nature, and fellow human beings in different countries.

A man with knowledge and application skills in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology can benefit his fellow humans in different countries by producing computers, cell phones, etc. Or by developing technology like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radio, remote, wireless, USB, etc. 

Thus, a man can become rich like the heads of TATA, BIRLA, Infosys, Amazon, and Google companies and experience heavenly pleasures in this human life. 

Those (like me) who do not have the necessary amount of knowledge or application skills in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology to innovate, design, produce or formulate incentive schemes to sell any product but want to convert to virtuous souls, share the thoughts with those who want to benefit their fellow human beings in this world. 
 
If any male who hates the Brahman religion has any inkling of being virtuous can also start sharing the thoughts/ideas that would benefit fellow human beings in this world."

@gbhatia9809,1 day ago,"Ayodhya‚Äôs Ram Temple is not only a matter of faith but reflects India‚Äôs civilizational identity. The core identity of India is based on Hinduism and  Indian nationalism & secularism comes naturally to most Indians because of this core identity. 
According to French political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot successful modern democracies have adopted Cultural Secularism by conjuring of the faith as a political identity marker in the public sphere while relegating theological aspects of the religion to the private sphere.
 In Western liberal democracies, the state is Christian but the governments pursues secular policies. In Germany, Italy & Sweden political parties call themselves Christian Democratic Union, Christian Democratic Center & Christian Democratic Party.

@gbhatia9809,17 hours ago (edited),"¬†@ladusingh2141¬† Following Ashoka‚Äôs disbanding of army & adoption of Buddhism, virtually entire population of India had turned peaceful & Budhist. Seeing capitulation of Buddhist Avagana (Afghanistan) & fall of Sindh where half Buddhist population of King Dahir refused to fight, a political sage rose from South India- Adi Sankara who cris-crossed India to revive Hinduism, established 4 Mathas (Monasteries) in 4 corners of India along with smaller Sarda Peeth in Kashmir.
Preaching Mahabharata which ordained religious duty on Warrior class (Kshatriyas) to fight enemies to save society, he reconverted India into Hinduism for which earned title of Jagadguru, a title only bestowed to Lord Krishna before. 
Rajputs were the formidable Kshatriyas who blunted 800 yrs. of onslaught of Muslim invaders from 8th Century onward. Sikhs & Marathas came much later from 16th -18th centuries. Hindu kings all over India including in the south put up brave resistance against Muslim invaders. 
Rajput women proved to be formidable double edged sword. Resolving to commit mass suicides in the form of Jauhar, they propelled their warrior husbands to fight with double vigor & discouraged Islamic invaders denying them their much sought after female war booty. Later Sikh women also adopted this tactic by jumping into the well. 
Zoroastrian Persia fell, Buddhist Afghanistan fell, both  got completely Islamized but a sage Adi Sankara saved India."
@gbhatia9809,17 hours ago (edited),"¬†@reebavarghese4123¬† British Nobel laureate late Sir VS Naipaul who had written several books on India had poor opinion of India,  but finally in 2013 admitted in his ‚ÄúA million Mutinies Now‚Äù : Country is ‚Äúfull of the signs of growth‚Äù, all the signs of an ‚ÄúIndian, and more specifically, Hindu awakening‚Äù.
This Core Identity of India is Hinduism.
This core identity was subverted by the Congress & polluted by Marxists & pseudo liberals planted & aided by the Congress which thrived on Vote Bank politics by pampering minority traits but simultaneously cleverly creating insecurity,  & ghetto mentality in the minorities. Downgrading & subverting  Hinduism to garner minority votes was made premier policy sapping energy, enthusiasm, image & progress of the entire country. 
Max Weber, the German Social Scientist said economic growth goes hand-in-hand with  collective worldview & core identity of  a society & with his data-driven research proved why Protestants had far outpaced Catholics in generating wealth and industrializing. 
The collective world view of Hindus has changed who have now realized the importance of their long neglected religion & culture. 
BJP is rising because it has made modern India understand the difference between national identity & secularism,  Only Congress, Marxists & Indian pseudo liberals are unable to fathom the difference. 
No wonder, the people of modern India have found Congress unfit to hold even the Leader of Opposition status in 2 back to back elections by dumping it with less than 10% Lok Sabha seats necessary to claim such a status. The Communists were dumped with less than 1% seats."

@gbhatia9809,16 hours ago,"¬†@reebavarghese4123¬† Both India & Israel are modern democracies with their historic cultures deeply rooted in religion. While India is a Hindu majority secular, democratic nation with 80% Hindu & 14% Muslim population,  Israel is a declared Jewish, democratic nation with 21% Muslim Israeli Citizens, more than that of India. Yet Israel has virtually no problems from its Muslims - no communal riots. 
Israeli Muslims respect Jews for eating Kosher meat & boycotting Halala meat. Israeli politicians do not  attend or host Iftar parties to flaunt their secularism. 
Israeli Muslims do not throw halala caracass or Crabs in synagogues  let alone damage them. And, Israeli Muslims have best educational & living standards in the region among Muslims.  
The problem of Muslims in India is because of Pseudo-Secularism cultivated by Congress &  wily Pseudo-Secularists by instilling fear & insecurity and promoting ghetto-mentality among minority to garner captive  vote-bank benefits.
Indian politicians fool Muslims by hosting Iftar parties, displaying ear to ear smile wearing Muslim Faiz caps, even though it is inappropriate for already tummy filled, non-fasting, non-Muslim to join in a fasting Muslim congregation let alone host it. People of India have now realized that they look nothing but hypocrite secular Jokers. 
Rajiv Gandhi amended Constitution to reverse  SC judgment in Shah Bano case in 1985,  Congress dummy PM ManMohan Singh  went a  steps further declaring  Muslims have the first right to the resources of India. All Pseudo-secularists satanically converted Ayodhya's  Ram Janma Bhumi site into the intractable Jerusalem's Temple Mount type site using threat to secularism to deny 1Bn  Hindus right to worship at their revered Apex Religious Site.

@user-hi6yh2cv5q,1 day ago (edited),"¬†@kalavenkateswaran7504¬†  no, we know they are also misled but for Hindu to fall to their category of meaningless beliefs is truly disheartening. Reincarnation is the way of nature, Hindus know this but how comes they failed to know that the God who created such means never demanded any form of worship from His children who are eternally part of him? How comes they failed to know that earth is a school and nothing more where we learn how to love. Was that knowledge left out or is there but ignored?"

@user-hi6yh2cv5q,1 day ago (edited),"¬†@icouldntthinkofabettername...¬† your point is correct, such should be places where people are taught how  to connect to their higher selves rather be told that someone is going to give them something if they pray. They should be taught that they are more than their physical bodies and be told how they can temporarily disconnect from their physical bodies and learn for themselves who they truly are. Most Ashrams are doing a great job except the belief aspect. They should be taught and confirm for themselves through experience that death is nonexistent."

@user-hi6yh2cv5q,1 day ago,"¬†@icouldntthinkofabettername...¬† we need to look beyond the materialism. Look at Pyramids, they were once inaugurated like that temple but they never helped mankind evolve otherwise we could not be where we are, hating each other waring among ourselves. Those temples if they mean something, they should be used to provide a clear path to human evolution. May be, they should install Kozyrev mirrors and floatation tanks in those temples so that people can get connected to their higher selves rather than depend on religious leaders who are prone to political and economic interferences."

Also you can't equate, especially a Dharmic place of worship to only a ritual, temples(particularly ancient ones') have a pleasant aura and peace in their areas of prathistha. A devotee gets to experience that and even many Carvakas tend to agree to this."

@user-hi6yh2cv5q,1 day ago (edited),"¬†@varun2250¬† old beliefs, beliefs based on beliefs over thousands of years needs to be left behind. Look at human beings and around you, do you think those beliefs have served the society? We need to connect to our higher selves and current beliefs are blocking that. For example, I was born into a Christian family where sinners go to hell. I have come to learn and realise that hell does not exist and satan does not exist. I also have come to know that we are all eternal children of God/the source of all and we are all connected and one. Earth is a school where we learn how to be generators of unconditional love, just like our eternal Father of all beings. These are not beliefs but knowing. Some of these facts are in the bible vaguely and others are not. 
I know reincarnation is a fact but there is no punishment associated with it but learning and evolving. Our temples should be places where people are taught how to connect to their higher selves and access the knowledge of who we truly are instead of just believing. 

Just imagine if someone who would have become a rapist experienced being everyone and everyone being him, would he turn up to be a rapist? This experience takes place at life review, a place beyond physical reality but is accessible to all of us if we all knew how to get there. Public Temples should be places of teaching such kind of knowledge and not places of spreading baseless beliefs that get us stack rather than move forwards in the evolution curve."
@varun2250,1 day ago,"¬†@user-hi6yh2cv5q¬† I clearly understand where you are coming from but there's still lots of groundwork to be done to make people realise their connect with Brahman/the existence/the Universe and all the Universes. 

It's too ideal to ask what you said because right now even getting the ancestral, original places of worship back is itself has taken this much amount of time."
@user-hi6yh2cv5q,1 day ago (edited),"¬†@varun2250¬† what do you think would be the impact if 10% of the human race became full aware of who they are from the knowing and not just believing? In the united states, floatation tanks and centres are commercial but many people don't know the capability of such tools that cuts  all external stimuli, enhances body relaxation and let one focus on oneself as Dr. John C. Lilly discovered. Whom do you think should champion the use of such tools by the masses to jump start our evolution of human consciousness? I say human consciousness because our consciousness will continue even without humans. The ones who need help is human beings otherwise, they will go extinct or devolve as they have been doing millions of years."

@user-hi6yh2cv5q,22 hours ago (edited),"¬†@tryit2136¬† the problem is, there are beliefs that cannot be verified. For example, if the time travel aspects of human consciousness can used to explore the validity of the basis of some of the beliefs that we hold dear, that would settle that. May going back in time to verify whether the many gods worshipped were gods at all, that would settle that. This is why we need to learn how to connect to our higher selves."

@tryit2136,21 hours ago,"¬†@user-hi6yh2cv5q¬† what you are talking about in your parent comment is alr in one of our school of thought.
its called vednata philosophy.
and even that is categorized into two.
and both are true in a way depends how u see it.
but not everybody has vedanta mindset. some  are just more comfortable with devotion.
some are like what i see is what i consider truth."
@user-hi6yh2cv5q,19 hours ago (edited),"¬†@tryit2136¬† you see, instead of having just a school of thought and devotion why not provide means for people to experience what truly is or what all is one and one is all truly means from the knowing rather than just believing.

Let me put it this way, if there are two people, of the two, one experiences the oneness with with everything and one just believes. Who of the two is going to appreciate the existence of others more and may be not hurt them when such opportunity presents itself?Especially, when not in the context of self defense which is an innate survival instinct."
@tryit2136,16 hours ago,"¬†@user-hi6yh2cv5q¬†  yes thats why hindusim has  other school of thoughts aswell like vedanta,ayurveda,vaishasheeka,yoga etc.
 if u see hindu scriptures upnishads and all they are literally question and answers.

devotion is inclusive and its very personal thing.
it cannot be explained rather experinced."
@user-hi6yh2cv5q,15 hours ago (edited),"¬†@tryit2136¬† Experience is key but as a human race don't you think it is time to move forward as a unit. We think we have all the time for each individual to evolve, as souls, yes we have infinite time but as human beings, time is running out. There is a potential future beyond the year 3500 where the current human beings no longer exist. All those temples are gone, all human creation is gone and the planet and the beings that live there are beautiful. They experience life from atomic level to planetary level and beyond. That is beautiful but the current humans are gone. Time is a luxury we don't have. We need to connect to our higher selves and we need means to do so. First we need knowledge of who we are and Hindu religions has schools for that purpose but as I said, time is a luxury we truly don't have. The knowledge on how current human beings disappeared at that time is unknown. We are focused so much on materials that we have forgotten ourselves and may be that is why our time as human beings is running out fast. There is an English saying,"" Out of site, out of mind"", and since all that is in our mind is materials, human beings have already become extinct without knowing."

They also provide free food to millions everyday. 

regarding environment, India is already leading the world in renewable energy programs.

Though will the blind haters ever become educated enough to see these facts ? Only time will tell.

Also temple is built for the devotees by the devotees.

If you think it‚Äôs responsibility of Hindu temples to eradicate poverty, clean environment etc then stop electing your government and just give temple the highest authority in country. If you can‚Äôt do that then don‚Äôt have silly expectations which just make you look like an idiot rather an intellectual."

@malinisarovar,1 day ago,"Banking on a temple to boost India's soft power, even the need of discussing it in social media is not very promising for India's future. Religion has to be a personal choice. We don't want religion to be a factor to assert our power anywhere. Rather individuals should assert their power on their individual capabilities , talents and efforts. The same goes for the country. Sriram is always here, with or without the temple. If we can only feel his presence by a temple being built in Ayodhya, then all of us need to go back and study Ramayanam again and this time learn it the right way. Building this temple after all the tragic events that occured in past several hundred years, is historic and is a reason to rejoice for all those who has been waiting for this. Please leave it at that and don't connect it to the country's power."

The event scheduled for January 22nd, is not just being awaited by citizens of India, but by devotees and followers from around the world. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad  organized a car rally in New Jersey, United States as an early commemoration of the Pran Pratistha ceremony, with participation from the Hindu community across the region. The fervor extends to Nepal and Sri Lanka as well, with both countries contributing sacred gifts for the temple's construction. The Ram Lalla Idol, a symbol central to the temple's significance, is now stationed in the garbhagraha. The preparations for the temple's opening are shining a light on the unifying strength of shared devotion, transcending geographical boundaries. With excitement building across the globe, the Ram temple's opening is set to be a landmark moment not only for Ayodhya and India, but for the devotees worldwide."

@FunnyIntelligentInnocentKids,2 days ago,"AHMEDABAD:¬†Gujarat still has a long way to go on the nutrition front as 38.09 per cent of the population in the state is undernourished, according to the National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, released by Niti Aayog in July this year. Nearly half of the rural Gujarat population is deprived of nutrition (44.45 per cent), while the figure for urban areas is 28.97 per cent.

According to the Niti Aayog report, backward states such as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have fared comparatively better than Gujarat on the nutrition front. Gujarat ranked fourth in terms of stunted children, according to data from NFHS 5 (National Family Health Survey). Thirty-nine per cent of children in the state are underweight for their age.

Furthermore, Gujarat ranked second in terms of wasted and underweight children, at 25.1 per cent and 39.7 per cent, respectively.¬† This reflects the state‚Äôs poor performance in terms of health metrics.

Analysing the MPI numbers, Atman Shah, Professor of Economics at St Xavier‚Äôs College, Ahmedabad, said, ‚ÄúNutrition is a serious cause for concern. In 2016, around 33.6 per cent of West Bengal families and 41.37 per cent of Gujarat households had at least one malnourished member. By 2021, this figure has dropped to 27.3 per cent in West Bengal and 38.9 per cent in Gujarat.‚Äù

Data clearly shows that three out of every 100 individuals in Gujarat were suffering from malnutrition during this time period, whilst West Bengal fared better with less than six out of every 100 people suffering from the condition, Shah added. Gujarat‚Äôs performance in housing also leaves room for improvement when compared to other states"

@yashasvi_karsh,11 days ago,""" Seems a disciple of a peaceful relegion. ""
it was the matter of almost 500 years since demolition.
 ~half time since Arbi SHIT was found.
The claim that there is no evidence of Ram or Ram Mandir at the location in Ayodhya is disputable. Historical and archaeological research has suggested the presence of ancient structures at the site, supporting the belief in the existence of a Ram Temple. Additionally, the cultural and religious sentiments associated with Lord Ram hold significance for a large section of the population, making the construction of a Ram Temple a matter of faith and identity.

While acknowledging the historical presence of Buddhist artifacts, it's crucial to recognize the coexistence of diverse religious and cultural influences throughout history. Building a Ram Temple doesn't negate the importance of Buddhist heritage but rather reflects the rich tapestry of our cultural history.



Labeling the construction as an atrocity against specific social groups oversimplifies the complex dynamics involved. It's essential to foster inclusivity and dialogue, respecting the sentiments of all communities. The notion that Ayodhya's name contradicts Rama's warrior status is based on linguistic interpretation rather than historical evidence, highlighting the importance of relying on comprehensive research and scholarly discourse in such matters."
@legaleagle8078,13 days ago,Certainly all the principles of lord ram has been followed in building his temple. I wonder how lord ram would have reacted if such temple would have built in his era?? The purshottam and the ideal person would not have approved it. How you can be happy when other children of god are sad? Infact our heart is our temple where god reside and you search him in temples. God is everywhere he is omnipresent.

UAE is in ocean where such cleaning is acceptable. But aquarium cleaning in sacred Saryu is unacceptable. That will make Saryu water dirty. 
As Yamuna already is .
So, please, ban Masjid Mohammad Abdulla being built in Bharat Varsh. That is more suitable for Mecca and Media. Unsuitable for Bharat varah aryavata. 

Characteristics of Maryada purushotam Shree Raam  do not match with sexually liberated Mohammad Abdulla characteristics and moral values.

This temple is a tribute to our ancestors who had to suffer indefinitely and live under a under a constant threat of extinction, not for a mere few years but for centuries, but they still refused to give up or let our 10000+ years old ancestral civilisation go extinct on the hands even the most brutal, barbaric and inhuman adversary. This is why Sanatan Dharm is the oldest religion in the world and the only living Dharma. May Bhagwan Ram and Maa Sita bless us all and help us regain our lost glory.

@nirveshdagar,2 weeks ago,"Certainly! Here is a longer piece on Lord Shri Ram:

Lord Shri Ram, the revered seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu in Hinduism, stands as a symbol of virtue, righteousness, and divine grace. The epic Ramayana, a sacred scripture in Hinduism, narrates the extraordinary life and deeds of Lord Ram, guiding millions of devotees on the path of dharma and spiritual awakening.

Born in Ayodhya to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya, Lord Ram's divine aura was evident from his early days. His childhood exploits, including the breaking of Lord Shiva's bow to win the hand of Sita in marriage, foreshadowed the greatness that would define his life. As he embarked on his journey, the epic tale unfolded, revealing Lord Ram's unwavering commitment to truth and righteousness.

The essence of Lord Ram's character lies in his adherence to dharma, the righteous and moral order governing the universe. His exile to the forest, a consequence of fulfilling his father's promise to his stepmother Kaikeyi, exemplifies his commitment to duty above personal desires. Accompanied by his devoted wife Sita and loyal brother Lakshman, Lord Ram embraced the challenges of the wilderness with grace and fortitude.

The pinnacle of Lord Ram's trials came with the abduction of Sita by the demon king Ravana. The epic battle that ensued, culminating in the defeat of Ravana and the rescue of Sita, symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. Lord Ram's unwavering commitment to justice and righteousness became a beacon of hope for humanity, inspiring generations to confront adversity with courage and conviction.

The Ram Rajya, Lord Ram's reign as the ideal king in Ayodhya, is a legendary chapter in Hindu philosophy. During this period, Ayodhya prospered under his just and compassionate rule, establishing an era of harmony, prosperity, and ethical governance. The term ""Ram Rajya"" has transcended its mythological roots to signify an idyllic state of existence marked by justice, equality, and righteous leadership.

Lord Shri Ram's teachings, encapsulated in the conversations with sages like Vishwamitra and his encounters with various characters like Hanuman, underscore the principles of dharma and the path to spiritual enlightenment. The Hanuman Chalisa, a devotional hymn dedicated to Lord Hanuman, encapsulates the essence of devotion, loyalty, and the divine connection between the worshipper and the worshipped.

Devotees across the globe celebrate Lord Shri Ram through various festivals, with Ram Navami being one of the most significant. On this auspicious day, followers fast, read the Ramayana, and participate in prayers to commemorate the divine birth of Lord Ram. The recitation of the Sundara Kanda, a book in the Ramayana narrating Hanuman's journey to Lanka, is considered particularly auspicious during this time.

The cultural impact of Lord Shri Ram extends beyond religious boundaries. His life has inspired countless literary works, dance dramas, and artistic expressions, transcending geographical and linguistic barriers. The Ram Leela, a traditional form of storytelling through theatrical performances, has been a cornerstone of cultural celebrations, fostering a sense of community and shared devotion.

In the heart of Ayodhya, the Ram Janmabhoomi, believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, holds immense significance for devotees. The construction of the Ram Mandir at this sacred site has been a focal point of devotion, marking a historic moment for millions who have longed to see a grand temple dedicated to their beloved Lord.

Beyond the epic narrative, Lord Shri Ram's life serves as a spiritual guide, offering profound insights into the nature of existence and the pursuit of a purposeful life. His teachings emphasize the importance of duty, righteousness, and devotion, serving as a compass for navigating the complexities of the material and spiritual realms.

The philosophical underpinnings of Lord Shri Ram's life resonate in the concept of ""Ram Rajya"" as an ideal socio-political order. It envisions a society where justice prevails, leaders uphold righteous governance, and citizens live harmoniously, adhering to ethical principles. This utopian vision continues to inspire leaders, thinkers, and policymakers to strive for a just and compassionate world.

Devotees often find solace and strength in chanting the name of Lord Ram, as it is believed to have transformative powers. The repetition of the divine mantra, ""Ram Naam,"" is a practice embedded in the spiritual journey, fostering a deep connection with the divine and providing solace during challenging times.

In conclusion, the saga of Lord Shri Ram extends far beyond the realms of mythology. It is a timeless narrative that transcends generations, cultures, and borders, serving as a beacon of divine guidance and moral principles. Lord Ram's life, teachings, and legacy continue to shape the spiritual consciousness of millions, offering a profound understanding of life's purpose and the eternal quest for righteousness and truth."

Genesis ch 6: Wickedness in the World 6 When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, 2 the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. 3 Then the Lord God said, ‚ÄúMy Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.‚Äù 4 The Nephilim (demons) were on the earth in those days‚Äîand also afterward‚Äîwhen the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. 5 The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. 6 The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled and grieved. 7 So the Lord said, ‚ÄúI will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created‚Äîand with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground‚Äîfor I regret that I have made them.‚Äù8 But (one man)  Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. The Lord said to Noah, 14 ""So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.17 I am going to bring flood waters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. 18 But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark‚Äîyou and your sons and your wife and your sons‚Äô wives with you. 19 You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. 20 Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. 21 You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.‚Äù 22 Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
Genesis 7:1The Lord then said to Noah, ‚ÄúGo into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. 2 Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, 
Genesis 7 :7And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons‚Äô wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. 8 Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground, etc.  10 And after the seven days the flood waters came on the earth. On that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the flood gates of the heavens were opened. 12 And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
17 For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark . 20 The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits.21 Every living thing that moved on land perished‚Äîbirds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. 22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
14 By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.
15 Then God said to Noah, 16 ‚ÄúCome out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives. 17 Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you‚Äîthe birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground‚Äîso they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it.‚Äù
GENEOLOGY FROM NOAH TO ABRAM:
Genesis 9 :1Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. 12 And God said, ‚ÄúThis is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: 13 I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
10:1 This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah‚Äôs sons, who themselves had sons after the flood.
31 These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
32 These are the clans of Noah‚Äôs sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
Genesis 11:1Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. 2 As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. 6 The Lord said, ‚ÄúIf as one people, speaking the same language, they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.‚Äù 8 So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.
10 This is the account of Shem‚Äôs family line. From Shem to Abram (who was called Ram or Ramah and his wife Sarai (Sita, sitna, sithai - as per transliteration). Genesis 12 God blessed them. Genesis 17:3 Abram fell face down, and God said to him, 4 ‚ÄúAs for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations. 5 No longer will you be called Abram ; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.
15 God also said to Abraham, ‚ÄúAs for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah. 16 I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.‚Äù"

@eshwarprasad524,2 days ago,"Brother I'm a Hindu but I revere Lord Buddha. Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism are unique because the common man in ancient India never worried about it and worshipped Bodhisattvas, Devas, Thirthankaras together. Even the monks might have had rivalry with each other, but they inspired each other in developing philosophy and even meditated together for spiritual realization
Hindu and Buddhist Kings gave money to develop Temples and Stupas. Even now in SE Asia Buddhists worship Hindu Gods indirectly as Bodhisattvas
We are all Sanathanis and must work together to spread Dharma."

@knowledgeisinfinitefreeedu9125,2 weeks ago,"Temple Economy (Mandir Eco System) is the largest wealth generator that can boost any country's economy, by providing direct & indirect employment and great business opportunities.  The Temple economy was an integral part of Sanathana Dharma in our Bharath which generated 30% of the world's GDP for Bharath & made our country the wealthiest/richest country in the world, we used to sell Gold, Silver,  Dimond, and other precious metals ornaments in the street @Kilogram measurement. Our Temples were acting as wealth management centers and also as educational centers before the Foreign Abrahamic invasion by ISLAM & Christianity. 

After the invasion by the Foreign Abrahamic Conversion Mafia our Temple Economy was systematically destroyed by the Invaders to spread their propaganda and to Run the Conversion Mafia & to loot our country's wealth, Our temples were looted & destroyed, and our value-based Job oriented Gurukul education system was destroyed, Countless Innocent people were brutally murdered, tortured Just because of Belief. Our real History was totally twisted as part of Abrahamic Propaganda to destroy our vibrant ancient civilization.  By 1947 GDP of India had dropped to 4% we can imagine how much wealth was looted from our country by the 2 Invading Foreign Abrahamic Mafia's. 

 Here we need to understand that Conversion is the systematic Foreign Abrahamic process of creating enemies for our own country/culture using our own population by brainwashing them and making them Blind believers. Already our Bharath has paid a heavy price of Partition for this Conversion Mafia. Each and every person living in Bharath & following ISLAM / Christianity (99% of them) in our country today was just converted MAX 4-5 generations Back either by offering materialistic benefits OR  it must be forceful conversion by threatening the person. So we need to consider Conversion as a serious crime against our Bharath's Sovereignty. 

Irrespective of forcefully implanted blind/illogical belief system by immature /illogical Foreign Abrahamic Mafia everything in this universe by Nature Sanathani only this is an undeniable fact of this Universe. There is no discrimination in Nature whatsoever. Any Living beings in this Universe that use 5 essential elements of nature  (Air, Water, Soil, Space, and Fire) Known as Pancha Bhoota for survival are considered Sanathani only because life is part of Nature which is Sanathana which is eternal."

Greater Magadha is a concept in studies of the early history of India.[1] It is used to refer to the political and cultural sphere that developed in the lower Gangetic plains (Johannes Bronkhorst defines the region to comprise modern day Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh) during the Vedic age.

When one questions why Shri Ram is revered in so many countries, the reasons are perhaps more than historical. During the course of his life and struggles, to his ultimate victory, Shri Ram espoused the values of personal integrity, a sense of duty, patience, humility, fortitude and valour. To Hindus and to global believers, Shri Ram was perhaps the earliest known example of a person who despite his birth into royalty and grandeur, faced the travails of his life with the strength of character, so much so that he has become the epitome of ethical, moral and spiritual values, that resonate across cultural and geographical boundaries."

whereas India's history starts going back 5000 years in the entire Indian subcontinent, we have our own unique religion culture language and foods. 

do some  research before comment on India, one of the worlds oldest country that's  got one of the oldest civilisation in the world. 

India's history doesn't start in 1947, Indian had many ancient Indian empire  and we are the native of the Indian subcontinent"

Nepal are people just wanting to be special, this is why you look at India every time, you don't look at Tibet china. You just see India and start mimicking Indians.

British kept Nepal as buffer state from china. So that china don't conquer India for themselves. Which worked for the British.

you look at Nepal, its poor even though its not been looted or conquered  by invaders

what do Nepal know about Hinduism.  your not even classed as native s to the religion"
@napakistanmedia6772,2 weeks ago,"¬†@anujsapkota502¬† 
Indians civilisation is one of the oldest in the world. Nepoor don't have its own civilisation.

Hinduism is only native to India. 100% are all Indians. they are no Nepali sages in Hinduism. Skanda puran is Indian literature and tells poems of India (barat varsa) and is written in Sanskrit language. Sanskrit language from India.

No ""foreigners"" allowed in Hinduism. (Nepalis)ü§£ü§£"

Nepal opened its Embassy in London in 1923 when a half of the world including India was under the British Flag .
The full independence of Nepal when a half of the world was under British Colonial Empire , would be a pride for every Hindu in India and the World .
Nepal shall be the capital of the Hindu World from the Fiji Islands in the Pacific to the United States in the Western Hemisphere . 
India shall immediately withdraw from its unholy occupation of the holy soil of Nepal . Failing to do so would bring disintegration of India by Lord Gorakhnath and Lord Pasupatinath ."

Indian heritage is for Indians, countries like Nepal Pakistan Bangladesh and so on cannot separate from India but wants Indian heritage as theirs and also wants to  Indian civilisation, as theirs also.

They cannot have it both ways!!
they chose to separate from India by they own will.

We worship the 'vigraha'..'arch vigrah'....'deity' or even the 'murti' after pran pratisthan.( a spiritual process that bestows grace on the material form, making it spiritual in essence)..hence murti shd t be confused with ,'statue'...
In common parlance and with innocent simplicity people have called God's form in the temple as a statue or even idol. And that is cos devotees are not hung up on any meaning attached to the presence of their beloved Lord. However, Abrahmic religions that have a stated theological agenda have used the Hindu open ness to diminish the spiritual practice in the temples and in the people's hearts. Please bear this in mind and stop using the word 'idol'."

@lindas9302,3 weeks ago,@ShivamVerma-108¬† Pratima or Murti both are better than Idol. Probably people will be more familiar with Murti. Either is better than Idol which is a very very negative word. Jai Shri Ram from this Chinese Hindu üïâ!!

@ShivamVerma-108,3 weeks ago,¬†@lindas9302¬† Sure Sister welcome to Bharat the heaven of Dharma and Knowledge just some work is needed to be done to properly clean our country of some dirt which got collected in last few centuries üòâ
@lindas9302,3 weeks ago,"@ShivamVerma-108¬† We know well, luckily we put all ours in a certain province away from everyone civilized. üòâ You know during Yuan dynasty (don't be fooled by the name, it wasn't a Chinese Dynasty, it was Mongolian rule over China) they forbid Han Chinese from using kitchen knives? Every 10 streets there would be 1 knife on a chain watched by a Mongol guard and Han people would have to take turns to use it. People have forgotten that history of ours under Kublai Khan. Also many atrocities like murder and rape happened in China under the Khanate (Chingis Khan's son Kublai Khan and the rest)."
@lindas9302,3 weeks ago,Please use the word Murti instead of Idol. Idol has very negative connotations. If you keep using the word Murti instead it will be added to the English dictionary just like Googling or Chit etc.
@ravigummula1108,3 weeks ago,"‚Å†¬†@lindas9302¬†Hinduism is a great one and only sanathana darma, I believe it. Sanathana darma was spread in world wide. It‚Äôs good news for all Hindu communities. So many temples was destroyed from 1400 years. I think now it‚Äôs time to follow Hinduism back again with reconstructing our temples."
